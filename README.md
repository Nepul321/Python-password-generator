# Python-password-generator
This is a strong password generator build with python and tkinter.

Tkinter is a python gui toolkit that can be used to build simple GUIs easily and quickly.

Great thing about tkinter is it already comes installed with python.

To build this project you need only 1 extra python package called "PyperClip".

I have included the name of it in the requirements.txt file.

Run "pip install pyperclip" without the quotes to install it on your computer.
